# Cedar Framework Structure

Cedar is an open source framework for building AI-native interfaces. Everything in the framework is designed to be extensible, generalizable, and extremely concise. Cursor should use the following guidelines when navigating and interacting with this codebase:

- Please use @ as a shortcut for packages/cedar, so `packages/cedar/` should be `@/`
- Package root: `packages/cedar/`
- Source directory: `packages/cedar/src/`
- Public API:
  - Entry point: `packages/cedar/src/index.ts`
  - All public exports are aggregated in this file.
- Directory structure under `src/`:
  - `components/`: React UI components.
  - `hooks/`: Custom React hooks.
  - `contexts/`: React context providers.
  - `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers.
  - `types/`: TypeScript types and interfaces.
  - `icons/`: SVG icon components.

## Cursor Navigation Rules
- Map imports from `@cedar/...` to their definitions in `packages/cedar/src/`.
- Always consult `src/index.ts` to identify the public API surface.
- For implementation details, search within the corresponding subdirectory (`components`, `hooks`, etc.).
- Use the `.cursor/rules` directory and `.mdc` extension conventions when creating or editing rules.
