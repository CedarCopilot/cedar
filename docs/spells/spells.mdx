# Spells

Spells are Cedar-OS's powerful system for creating contextual, gesture-based interactions that enhance your AI-native applications. They provide a unified way to bind keyboard shortcuts, mouse gestures, and selection events to custom UI behaviors and actions.

## What are Spells?

Spells are reusable interaction patterns that can be activated through various triggers:

- **Keyboard shortcuts** (single keys or combinations like `Ctrl+K`)
- **Mouse events** (right-click, double-click, modifier+click)
- **Text selection** (automatically activate when text is selected)
- **Programmatic activation** (trigger spells from code using `activate()`, `deactivate()`, or `toggle()`)

When activated, spells can display custom UI components, execute actions, or modify application state - all while integrating seamlessly with Cedar's AI capabilities.

## Why Use Spells?

Spells enable you to create sophisticated interactions that feel magical to users:

- **Contextual Actions**: Display radial menus, tooltips, or floating inputs exactly when and where users need them
- **Rapid Workflows**: Bind complex AI operations to simple gestures
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Hide advanced features behind intuitive activations
- **Custom Experiences**: Build unique interaction patterns tailored to your application

## Built-in Spells

Cedar-OS comes with several pre-built spells you can use immediately:

### RadialMenuSpell

A circular menu that appears on activation, perfect for quick actions:

- Activate with right-click or custom hotkey
- Supports emoji or Lucide icons
- Execute actions on release (hold mode) or click (toggle mode)

### TooltipMenuSpell

A contextual menu for text selections:

- Automatically appears when text is selected
- Can spawn floating inputs for AI interactions
- Perfect for text editing and annotation workflows

### QuestioningSpell

An interactive cursor that reveals hidden information:

- Press 'Q' to activate questioning mode
- Hover over elements with `data-question` attributes
- Display contextual tooltips with explanations

## Quick Start

```tsx
import { useSpell, Hotkey, ActivationMode } from 'cedar-os';

function MyComponent() {
	const { isActive, activate, deactivate, toggle } = useSpell({
		id: 'my-spell',
		activationConditions: {
			events: [Hotkey.SPACE],
			mode: ActivationMode.HOLD,
		},
		onActivate: () => console.log('Spell activated!'),
		onDeactivate: () => console.log('Spell deactivated!'),
	});

	// You can also trigger spells programmatically
	const handleButtonClick = () => {
		toggle(); // or activate() / deactivate()
	};

	return (
		<>
			{isActive ? <div>âœ¨ Magic is happening!</div> : null}
			<button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Toggle Spell</button>
		</>
	);
}
```

## Key Concepts

### Activation Modes

Spells support three activation modes that determine their lifecycle:

- **Toggle**: Press to activate, press again to deactivate
- **Hold**: Active while key/button is held down
- **Trigger**: Fire once with optional cooldown

### Event Types

Spells can respond to multiple event types simultaneously:

- **Keyboard Events**: Single keys or modifier combinations
- **Mouse Events**: Clicks, right-clicks, double-clicks
- **Selection Events**: Text selection in the document

### State Management

Spells are fully integrated with Cedar's state management:

- Automatic registration/cleanup with React lifecycle
- Access to Cedar store for AI operations
- Synchronization with other Cedar components
