# Cedar-OS

Cedar OS is an open-source framework for building the next generation of AI native software. For the first time in history, products can come to life. We want to help you build something with life.

- We're allowing applications to communicate like humans.
- Computers that conform to us.
- We're building a GUI for AI.

## Our Principles of Craft and Developer Experience

We have two primary principles.

**Simplicity.**

Cedar is built so that everything works out of the box. You want a working chat? Import `<ChatInput/>` and `<CedarMessages/>` and _it just works_.

**Craft.**

We believe in the craft and creativity of the community.

We believe that giving you control allows you to customise Cedar to what you want to build, and more importantly, what will make the user experiences better.

This is the reason we made Cedar-OS fully open source, this is why we allow you to download the code any component with one command, this is why we built the architecture in a way that lets you override any internal function with **one line**.

But we also want you to understand how it works on a behind the scenes level. At the end of each component (this will be filled in over time), we'll explain how the component is built and how you might customise it.

## What are AI-native experiences?

Traditionally, applications combine _functionality_ (e.g. the ability to send an email), with _user interfaces_ (the windows, text areas and buttons) that allow users to control and access the functionality.

Now AI can do stuff. But it can really communicate only in one way.

> If I want to tell you there is a spot on your shirt, I'm not going to do it linguistically: "There's a spot on your shirt 14 centimeters down from the collar and three centimeters to the left of your button." If you have a spot—"There!" [He points]—I'll point to it. Pointing is a metaphor we all know. We've done a lot of studies and tests on that, and it's much faster to do all kinds of functions, such as cutting and pasting, with a mouse, so it's not only easier to use but more efficient.

We help the AI understand the pointing and selecting you do.

> Graphic design, which has evolved over centuries, influences how we see, interpret, and use information. Typeface choices, layout, colors—all these details matter. They aren't just aesthetics; they shape understanding and productivity.

> _And it takes a long time for a medium to really fulfill its potential. Television itself wasn't just another form of radio. For years, it was just radio with pictures, but it took decades until television came into its own as a unique medium with storytelling, entertainment, and information that couldn't just be done on radio._
>
> _The same is true of computers. We're still in the early days. We're just figuring out what a computer medium really means to us socially, creatively, and educationally. But I believe we're at the start of a revolution, the computer generation replacing the television generation. And in time, it will change everything about how people communicate, learn, and work._

AI applications require new interfaces. Cedar-OS is the building blocks for those interfaces.

- For example, we can allow your user to control your app by talking to it.
- We allow the agent to know what's going on the application, and control it to do the work.

Applications traditionally allows the user to do work in pre-defined ways.

We are firm and deep believers in craft, and making software _human_.
