Spells are our aspirational name for intuitive and powerful interfaces for users to **control AI without text input**. They're called "spells" because we want the user to feel like they're casting a spell, a command followed by a magical experience.

One of the goals of Cedar is to give people ways to be creative and design human software, and we hope that this will be filled by innovative, fun solutions.

I could talk more about them, but here are some first initial versions.

### Examples

- Radial Menu
- Questioning Cursor
- Tooltip
- Gestures (coming soon)
