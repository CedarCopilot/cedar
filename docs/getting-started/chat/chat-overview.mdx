With one component, you can download a fully working chat. You also get all of the individual components of it, so you can customise styling, rendering, and functionality.

## Quick Start

To get started, choose one of the 3 types of chat. See [cedarcopilot.com/examples/cedar-playground](https://cedarcopilot.com/examples/cedar-playground) to see them in action.

### Chat Types

**Floating Chat**
A floating chat window that can be positioned on the left or right side of the screen with expand/collapse functionality. Perfect for customer support or assistance that doesn't interfere with the main application.

**Side Panel Chat**  
A side panel chat that pushes your main content to make room for the chat interface. Ideal for collaborative applications where chat is a primary feature alongside your main content.

**Bottom Center Chat**
A caption-style chat interface that appears at the bottom center of the screen, perfect for overlay-style interactions. Great for AI assistants that provide contextual help without taking up dedicated screen space.

<CodeGroup>

```tsx Floating Chat
import { FloatingCedarChat } from 'cedar-os-components';

function App() {
	return (
		<div>
			{/* Your main content */}
			<FloatingCedarChat
				side='right'
				title='Assistant'
				collapsedLabel='How can I help you today?'
				dimensions={{
					width: 400,
					height: 600,
					minWidth: 350,
					minHeight: 400,
				}}
				resizable={true}
			/>
		</div>
	);
}
```

```tsx Side Panel Chat
import { SidePanelCedarChat } from 'cedar-os-components';

function App() {
	return (
		<SidePanelCedarChat
			side='right'
			title='Chat Assistant'
			dimensions={{
				width: 600,
				minWidth: 300,
				maxWidth: 800,
			}}
			resizable={true}>
			{/* Your main page content goes here */}
			<div className='p-8'>
				<h1>Your App Content</h1>
				<p>This content will be pushed to the side when chat opens.</p>
			</div>
		</SidePanelCedarChat>
	);
}
```

```tsx Bottom Center Chat
import { CedarCaptionChat } from 'cedar-os-components';

function App() {
	return (
		<div>
			{/* Your main content */}
			<CedarCaptionChat
				dimensions={{
					width: 600,
					maxWidth: 800,
				}}
			/>
		</div>
	);
}
```

## Understanding & Customising Chat

Chat works through 2 main modules working together: **AgentInputContext** and **MessagesSlice**.

### 1. AgentInputContext

**AgentInputContext** manages everything that we pass into the agent. This includes not only the user message, but also:

- **State** that the agent is subscribed to ([learn more about state access](/getting-started/chat/subscribing-state))
- **User @mentions** of specific items in your application ([learn more about mentions](/getting-started/chat/mentions))
- **Conversation history** and contextual information
- **Custom context** you provide programmatically

This ensures your AI agent has full context about your application's current state and what the user is specifically referring to.

### 2. MessagesSlice

**MessagesSlice** takes care of the saving and rendering of messages. It handles:

- **Message storage** and conversation history
- **Message rendering** with support for different message types
- **Streaming responses** from AI providers
- **Custom message components** for rich interactions

## Understanding Sections

To fully customize and understand Cedar's chat system, explore these key areas:

### [MentionProvider](/getting-started/chat/mentions)

Learn how to allow users to @ mention items that are part of your application - whether that's users, tasks, files, or any other data in your system.

### [State Access](/getting-started/chat/subscribing-state)

Understand how to allow your agent to see and edit your local application states, making your AI assistant truly context-aware of your app's current state.

### [Agent Context](/getting-started/chat/agent-input-context)

Get an in-depth explanation of how agent context works, including advanced patterns for providing contextual information to your AI agents.

### Additional Customization

- **[Streaming](/getting-started/chat/streaming)** - Enable real-time response streaming
- **[Configuring the Cedar Editor](/getting-started/chat/configuring-cedar-editor)** - Customize the chat input experience
- **[Custom Message Rendering](/getting-started/chat/custom-message-rendering)** - Create custom message types and interactions

## Next Steps

1. **Try it out**: Visit the [Cedar Playground](https://cedarcopilot.com/examples/cedar-playground) to see all chat types in action
2. **Choose your style**: Pick the chat type that best fits your application
3. **Add context**: Set up state access and mentions to make your agent context-aware
4. **Customize**: Tailor the appearance and behavior to match your application's needs
