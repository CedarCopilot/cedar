# Getting Started

Cedar OS is an open-source framework for building the next generation of AI native software. For the first time in history, products can come to life. We want to help you build something with life.

## Key Capabilities

- **Applications that communicate like humans** - We're allowing applications to communicate naturally
- **Computers that conform to us** - Technology that adapts to human needs
- **A GUI for AI** - Visual interfaces designed for AI interaction

## Why Cedar-OS?

**Simplicity.** Cedar is built so that everything works out of the box. You want a working chat? Import `<ChatInput/>` and `<CedarMessages/>` and _it just works_.

**Craft.** We believe in the craft and creativity of the community. We give you control to customise Cedar to what you want to build, and more importantly, what will make the user experiences better.
