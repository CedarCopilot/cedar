# Our Philosophy

## Our Principles of Craft and Developer Experience

We have two primary principles.

**Simplicity.**

Cedar is built so that everything works out of the box. You want a working chat? Import `<ChatInput/>` and `<CedarMessages/>` and _it just works_.

**Craft.**

We believe in the craft and creativity of the community.

We believe that giving you control allows you to customise Cedar to what you want to build, and more importantly, what will make the user experiences better.

This is the reason we made Cedar-OS fully open source, this is why we allow you to download the code any component with one command, this is why we built the architecture in a way that lets you override any internal function with **one line**.

But we also want you to understand how it works on a behind the scenes level. At the end of each component (this will be filled in over time), we'll explain how the component is built and how you might customise it.

## Making Software Human

We are firm and deep believers in craft, and making software _human_.

Applications traditionally allow the user to do work in pre-defined ways. With Cedar-OS, we're changing that paradigm to create more natural, intuitive interactions between humans and AI.
