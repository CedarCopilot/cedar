# Architecture

## What are AI-native experiences?

Traditionally, applications combine _functionality_ (e.g. the ability to send an email), with _user interfaces_ (the windows, text areas and buttons) that allow users to control and access the functionality.

Now AI can do stuff. But it can really communicate only in one way.

> If I want to tell you there is a spot on your shirt, I'm not going to do it linguistically: "There's a spot on your shirt 14 centimeters down from the collar and three centimeters to the left of your button." If you have a spot—"There!" [He points]—I'll point to it. Pointing is a metaphor we all know. We've done a lot of studies and tests on that, and it's much faster to do all kinds of functions, such as cutting and pasting, with a mouse, so it's not only easier to use but more efficient.

We help the AI understand the pointing and selecting you do.

> Graphic design, which has evolved over centuries, influences how we see, interpret, and use information. Typeface choices, layout, colors—all these details matter. They aren't just aesthetics; they shape understanding and productivity.

## The Evolution of Computing Mediums

> _And it takes a long time for a medium to really fulfill its potential. Television itself wasn't just another form of radio. For years, it was just radio with pictures, but it took decades until television came into its own as a unique medium with storytelling, entertainment, and information that couldn't just be done on radio._

> _The same is true of computers. We're still in the early days. We're just figuring out what a computer medium really means to us socially, creatively, and educationally. But I believe we're at the start of a revolution, the computer generation replacing the television generation. And in time, it will change everything about how people communicate, learn, and work._

## Cedar-OS: Building Blocks for AI Interfaces

AI applications require new interfaces. Cedar-OS is the building blocks for those interfaces.

- For example, we can allow your user to control your app by talking to it.
- We allow the agent to know what's going on the application, and control it to do the work.

## Our Core Architecture

Cedar-OS bridges the gap between AI agents and React applications, providing a comprehensive framework for AI agents to read, write, and interact with your application state, just like users can.
