## How we built this

1. 🎯 **Spatial State Management**: Cedar-OS tracks canvas element positions, relationships, and properties in real-time
2. 🗣️ **Natural Language Control**: Users describe canvas modifications using natural language like "move the blue boxes to the left"
3. ⚡ **Dynamic Spells**: Custom spells for canvas operations like alignment, distribution, and grouping based on current context
4. 🔄 **Real-time Collaboration**: Multi-user awareness with change tracking for undo/redo and version control
5. 🧩 **Component Ecosystem**: Specialized canvas elements that respond to both direct manipulation and AI-driven modifications
6. 🔌 **Agent Automation**: AI analyzes canvas content and suggests optimal layouts and organizational structures
